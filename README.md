# Hotteling test and Confidence Region

> By Beatriz Lima and Vitória Sesana, two statistics students at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo.

This repository has an presentation (in portuguese) about inference about a mean in multivariate case. The hotteling test and confidence region are two common methods to make inference about the mean vector of p variables from a population. This presentation has formulas and some examples about this themes.  

To access the presentation, just go to the folder: *apresentacao_t2_rc -> slides -> slides_da_apresentacao.pdf ou slides_da_apresentacao.html*. 

In R. the package **xaringan** was choice because this package can be provide R code and your results. To access the presentation code, follow the path: *apresentacao_t2_rc -> slides -> slides_da_apresentacao.Rmd*.

The rest of the files are just sketches I made while working.
